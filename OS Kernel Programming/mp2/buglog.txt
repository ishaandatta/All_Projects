make: warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.

BUG: Text not appearing on status bar.
BUG: Text on status bar is stretched out. (writing to the same plane
repeatedly)
BUG: Text on status bar displaying random symbols. (out of bounds array
indexing while creating string to pass to text_to_image)
BUG: Character array of roomname and user's typing getting corrupted (indexing
out of bounds)
BUG: Character array not null terminated
BUG: 1 pixel not getting set in character array (off by 1)

OCTREES:
BUG 1:
Symptom: Only shades of red showing up 
Problem: Trailing zeroes in each RGB value were present when filling each
octree level
Solution: Bit shift out the trailing zeroes
BUG 2: 
Symptom: Enter screen pixelated
Problem: Incorrect indexing into pallette
Solution: Offset by 64 for pre-filled colors and correctly add offset for
number 4 level octree when filling pallette.

TUX:
BUG1:
Symptom: Set LED not displaying anything
Problem: Incorrect typecasting (character pointer incorrectly accessed/set)
Solution: Dereference array pointers for their zero index to give reference to
start of array

BUG2:
Symptom: Buttons IOCTL causing Kernel Panic
Problem: Attempting to set memory in user space from Kernel
Solution: Use system call copy_to_user

BUG3:
Symptom: Reset not restoring LED state
Problem: Restore LED in reset never getting called
Solution: Handle restoring LED as part of handling ACK

BUG4:
Symptom: ioctl calls causing Kernel panic from input.c
Problem: Not adding a break at the end of each switch case in IOCTLS
Solution: Add a break

BUG5: 
Symptom: Characters A through F displaying after 9 on LED while displaying
time
Problem: Display time on tux incrementing to Hexadecimal values
SOlution: Add a check for the mins value > 9 and shift digits appropriately to
display decimal values instead of hex

BUG6: 
Symptom: Spamming multiple buttons and reset causing program to break
Problem: Incorrectly handling ACKS
Solution: Create two flags, one for BIOC and one for LED, which get set
appropriately and create a state machine which handles INIT and RESET
separetely, and set LED calls seperately. 

BUG7:
Symptom: Race conditions in Driver (random symbols showing up during
compilation)
Problem: Global variables not being accessed atomically
Solution: Add locks to each access (read and write) for global variables

BUG8:
Symptom: IOCTL calls from Adventure.c don't execute 
Problem: File discriptor not able to be accessed
Solution: Declare fd as extern in input.c and call it in init_game (which is
called in adventure)

BUG9:
Symptom: Screen shaking/incorrectly showing up while running adventure with
tux enabled
Problem: Printk statements in driver code
Soltuion: Remove printk statements

BUG 10:
Symptom: Tux Thread never being executed
Problem: Incorrect opening/closing of the thread
Solution: Create cancel_tux_thread function and wake the tux thread in main
loop 

BUG 11:
Symptom: Tux controller not working with game
Problem: 

		BUG 12!!!!!!!!:
Symptom: TUX CONTROLLER AND KEYBOARD LAGGING DUE IN GAME 
Problem: THREAD SYNCHRONIZATION UNOPTIMALLY IMPLEMENTED
SOLUTION: SPEND 12 STRAIGHT HOURS FIGURING OUT OPTIMAL POSIX DESIGN, IMPLEMENT
IT (Reduce any locks which access shared variables in synch, ensure no live
locks/ dead locks edge cases are possible
