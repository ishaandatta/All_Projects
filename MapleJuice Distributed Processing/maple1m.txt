care must be taken when extracting a small portion from a large array which becomes useless after the extraction
because the small portion extracted contains a reference to the large original array whose memory will not be released until all arrays derived from it are garbage-collected

basic slicing extends python’s basic concept of slicing to n dimensions
numpy slicing creates a view instead of a copy as in the case of builtin python sequences such as string
tuple and list
care must be taken when extracting a small portion from a large array which becomes useless after the extraction
because the small portion extracted contains a reference to the large original array whose memory will not be released until all arrays derived from it are garbage-collected
